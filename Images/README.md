R Course for VTT Technical Research Center
=====

Dear data-savvy colleagues, you have landed on the homepage of R programming language course, given by me (Ouz).
Everything you will need for this course will appear (somewhat on-the-go) under this repository.
This course is aimed for anyone who has anything to do with any kind of *data*. It is composed of online, real-time lectures & some exercises for post-lecture fun. Lectures will be hands-on and practical (still accompanied by short lecture notes).

I will try to adjust the implementation (content, pace, requirements etc.) according to your needs and will try to add some homour and games whenever possible.
Please feel free to contact me anytime for questions, comments and/or feedback.

Exercises
-------
There will be exercises related to the lecture material almost as if you are not spending enough time in front of your computer day and night. 
I will try to to gamify these as much as possible and hopefully provide some options to choose from as well.


To-do
-------
This part is basically for myself
- [x] Create a course page
- [ ] Add instructions for installation R & RStudio
- [x] Publish the course content
- [ ] Add logos
- [ ] Check the code in Linux, Mac and Windows machines just in case
- [ ] Lecture 1 notes & exercises
- [ ] Brush up your statistics knowledge and double check the results in python
- [ ] Lecture 2 notes & exercises
- [ ] Collect opinions for application examples
- [ ] Ease down the machine learning stuff
- [ ] Lecture 3 notes & exercises
